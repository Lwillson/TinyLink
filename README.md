Create a short link at https://tnylnk.herokuapp.com

To get information on how many times users have gone to visit a short link, use the user_counts endpoint as such: https://tnylnk.herokuapp.com/links/#{id}/user_counts

example: https://tnylnk.herokuapp.com/links/3/user_counts

Authentication doesn't work end to end yet, especially when logging out :)
